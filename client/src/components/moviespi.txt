CREATING WATCH LIST WHERE WE CAN ADD/DELETE MOVIES

Set up your Watch List Data Structure:

Determine how you want to store the movie information in your app. You can choose an appropriate data structure like an array, a list, or a database.
Decide what information you want to store for each movie, such as title, release date, overview, and poster image URL.
Adding Movies to the Watch List:

Collect the necessary details for the movie you want to add, such as title, release date, overview, and poster image URL.
Create a new movie object with the collected details.
Add the movie object to your watch list data structure. The specific implementation will depend on the data structure you chose.
Deleting Movies from the Watch List:

Identify the movie you want to delete from the watch list, either by its unique ID or another identifying property.
Find the corresponding movie object within your watch list data structure.
Remove the movie object from the watch list.

CREATING DASHBOARD WHERE WE CAN ADD/DELETE MOVIES

Set up a Backend Server:

Create a backend server using a framework like Express.js (Node.js) or Django (Python).
Set up endpoints/routes to handle movie-related operations, such as adding and deleting movies.
Implement appropriate database connectivity to store and retrieve movie data.
Create API Endpoints:

Define an endpoint for adding a movie, such as /api/movies/add, and configure it to handle HTTP POST requests.
Handle the incoming request on the server, extract the movie details from the request body, and store them in the database.
Return an appropriate response, such as the newly added movie object or a success message.
Implement the Dashboard Component:

Create a dashboard component in your frontend application that allows users to enter movie details or select movies from a list.
Collect the necessary movie information, such as title, release date, overview, and poster URL, from user input or through API calls.
Make an HTTP POST request to the backend server's /api/movies/add endpoint, sending the movie data as the request payload.
Handle the response from the server, update the dashboard UI accordingly, and provide appropriate feedback to the user.
Handle Movie Deletion:

Add a delete button or another mechanism in your dashboard UI to allow users to delete movies.
When the delete action is triggered, make an HTTP DELETE request to the backend server's endpoint for deleting movies, such as /api/movies/delete/{movie_id}.
Pass the appropriate movie ID as part of the request URL to identify the movie to be deleted.
Handle the response from the server, update the dashboard UI, and provide appropriate feedback to the user.

CREATE FEED WHERE WE CAN ADD/DELETE MOVIES

User Authentication and Authorization:

Implement user authentication and authorization mechanisms to allow users to create accounts, log in, and access the app.
Use a framework like Passport.js (Node.js) or Django's authentication system (Python) to handle user authentication and session management.
Assign roles or permissions to users to control access to certain features, such as adding and deleting movies.
User Profiles and Friendships:

Create user profiles that store additional information about each user, such as their username, profile picture, and a list of friends.
Implement functionality for users to send friend requests and accept or reject them.
Store the relationships between users in your database, indicating who is friends with whom.
News Feed:

Design and implement a news feed component that aggregates activities from users and their friends.
Define a data structure for storing feed items, such as adding movies or deleting movies, along with metadata like the user who performed the action and the timestamp.
Query the database to retrieve relevant feed items for each user and their friends, considering privacy settings and visibility preferences.
Adding Movies to the Feed:

Allow users to add movies to their personal watch lists, as explained in the previous steps.
When a user adds a movie, create a feed item associated with that action, including the user who added the movie, the movie details, and the timestamp.
Store this feed item in the database, associating it with the user and their friends.
Deleting Movies from the Feed:

Similarly, when a user deletes a movie from their watch list, create a feed item associated with that action and store it in the database.
Include relevant information in the feed item, such as the user who deleted the movie, the movie details, and the timestamp.
Displaying the Feed:

Fetch the feed items from the database for each user and their friends.
Design and implement a user interface to display the feed items in a chronological order, showing the activities of the user and their friends.
Consider pagination or infinite scrolling techniques to handle large feeds.
Remember to implement appropriate privacy settings, so users can control the visibility of their feed items and choose who can see their activities.

These steps provide a general outline of how you can create a feed where users and their friends can add and delete movies. The implementation details will vary based on your chosen backend framework, database structure, and frontend technologies.

Set up a React project and install necessary dependencies: react-bootstrap, apollo-boost, react-apollo, axios, react-router-dom, and jwt-decode.
Create React components for registration, login, movie feed, and movie form.
Use Bootstrap and React Bootstrap components to style and structure your UI.
Implement authentication flows, including registration and login pages using Axios for API requests and JWT for token management.
Set up Apollo Client to handle GraphQL queries and mutations.
Create GraphQL schemas and resolvers on the server to handle movie-related operations and feed retrieval.
Use Apollo Client to fetch and display the movie feed, including adding and deleting movies.

The choice between using Axios or Apollo Client depends on your specific requirements and preferences. Here's a comparison to help you make an informed decision:

Axios:

Axios is a widely-used HTTP client library that allows you to make HTTP requests from your frontend application to your backend server or external APIs.
It is simple and straightforward to use for making RESTful API calls.
Axios provides features like interceptors for request/response preprocessing, error handling, and configuring headers.
It can work with various backend frameworks and APIs, including RESTful, SOAP, and more.
Axios is a good choice if you primarily work with REST APIs and want a lightweight and flexible solution.
Apollo Client:

Apollo Client is a comprehensive GraphQL client that provides a seamless way to interact with GraphQL APIs from your frontend application.
It simplifies data fetching and management by allowing you to write GraphQL queries and mutations.
Apollo Client has features like caching, optimistic UI, automatic batching, and real-time subscriptions built-in.
It integrates well with Apollo Server on the backend, but it can also work with other GraphQL server implementations.
Apollo Client is a good choice if you are working with a GraphQL API and want to leverage the power of GraphQL for data fetching and manipulation.
If you are using a GraphQL API or plan to work extensively with GraphQL in your application, Apollo Client provides a more specialized and powerful solution. It simplifies the integration and management of data from your GraphQL server. On the other hand, if you are working with traditional RESTful APIs or have specific needs that align better with Axios, it may be a more suitable choice.

In some cases, you can even use both libraries in your application. For example, you can use Axios for general-purpose HTTP requests and Apollo Client for interacting with your GraphQL API.

Consider the specific requirements and needs of your application, including the API you are working with and the features you require, to make an appropriate choice between Axios and Apollo Client.
